This is the completed test sent by Zola to Lewaa Bahmad

After running `npm start` visit `localhost:3000` to see the user grid. 

To see the Wedding Website, visit `localhost:3000/wedding_website.html`

Note: Fonts weren't working with my Sketch app so they're probably off size.
In addition, the engagement photo is different because the one in the design 
was not provided as an asset.
